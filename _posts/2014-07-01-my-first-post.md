Well I got Jekyll up and running in two hours. Ready to start blogging in the future. I will also put my resume here and some ideas I have for projects.
While at it, I might also share some of the things I'm working on.

I'm passionate about open source and work as a Microsoft Dynamics NAV consultant.

As of the moment of writing this post there is not much going on open source wise for NAV so maybe I'll try
to influence that.

Thank you for your visit!
