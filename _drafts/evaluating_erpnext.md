I like to keep an eye out for what's going on in the world of software. To this end, once in a while I search the net for Open Source business software. In september 2013, Infoworld hands out awards to Open Source business projects; [Bossie Awards 2013: The best open source applications.](http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/119652/bossie-awards-2013-the-best-open-source-applications-226975#slide1).

From those I discovered [ERPnext](https://erpnext.com/). This was the first time I herd about this project and the small review from infoworld sparked my interest. I saw terms like python, webbased, comprehensive and bright future.

Let's see what ERPnext is all about.
